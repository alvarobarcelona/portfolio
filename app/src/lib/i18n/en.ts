    p1: "I am a trained Application Developer (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung) with 3 years of practical experience in backend development (PHP, MySQL) and agile project environments. During my apprenticeship, I was involved in the development and maintenance of Moodle plugins, implemented responsive frontends, and provided technical support to end users. Currently, I am specializing in modern web technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Node.js, independently developing full-stack applications with a focus on scalable architectures and clean code structures. In addition to my technical experience, I bring a strong business understanding from previous roles in the logistics and startup sectors and always approach software from a business perspective: solutions should simplify processes and create real added value. I am currently also working on integrating AI APIs into web applications.",
